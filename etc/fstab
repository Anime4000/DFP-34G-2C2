# The syntax of busybox's fstab entry's a little different than traditional
# mount, and doesn't work with the usual 'rootfs / rootfs rw 0 0' entry.
# Actually, it's not needed unless you're mounting from a non-nfs device,
# like a hard disk.  In that case, you probably need something like the 
# following:

# /dev/hda1       /               ext3    rw           1      1

proc            /proc           proc    defaults     0      0
sysfs           /sys            sysfs   defaults     0      0
#devpts          /dev/pts        devpts  defaults     0      0
#tmpfs           /var            tmpfs   rw     0      0
